The problem is a stack manipulation challenge, pretty standard. `push()`, `pop()`, `slice()`... And you have it.

The input was in a very tricky format, and because I don't have a life, I decided to parse it instead of generating clean data by hand. At the end of the day, there are just 9 arrays of characters which will be moved around.

With a clean solution in the first star, the second star in my case was removing a `reverse()` from my code, and that was it.
