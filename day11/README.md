Lot of parsing, then making sure the arrays and calculations are done properly.

# Second star

First challenge of the year that involves values that grow too big to be manipulated... and I failed. I had to look for ideas outside in order to be able to understand how to reduce the worry levels.

The answer is not _that_ complex, but might take time to grasp. As in all checks we are verifying if number can be divided by X, we can reduce the levels by getting the remainder of the current level divided by the least commom multiple of all possible checks. This involves a couple of extra functions but solution is just there.
