# First star

Daamn! I am not sure it was me or it was the statement, but I've fought with making my simplistic approach work for way too long time. First of all, read and understand the challenge, it's not as simple as it looks (or is it?). Then I tried to keep cycles and instructions in parallel and it was not working right. Instead I just increased the cycle counter by 2 when there was an addition instruction (2 times 1 value, to run the cycle check) and it worked at the first try.

# Second star

The challenge is super long to read and understand, maybe it's my post-flu brain but only when I jumped into it blindly was I able to solve the whole thing. The previous solution helped a lot and the biggest change is moving the place where the drawing takes place. (Also careful with 0-indexed values ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… a classic)
