I've encountered this kind of challenge before and decided to try a solution I've seen in other places: A data dictionary.

Of course, a lot of if-else would work just fine, but this is for learning as well.

The dictionary is just an object which contains in this case the scores relative to each possible game. In this case it's set up manually because the possibilities are low (9 values). If the possibilites are more extensive, it might not be possible at all to use this, or maybe there's a way to populate the dictionary programatically...

Once the dictionary is set, running the input against it gives the result immediately.

Dictionary usage was a great idea. With the updated statement, the values inside are modified and works in a moment.
