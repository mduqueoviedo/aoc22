## First star

First day is always a warming up. Create the repo, the environment, make sure github profile swapping works properly, etc.

Something I learned in a similar challenge is to split by `\n\n` which allows me to group directly what I want.

Once the groups are made, using a `reduce` allows to search for the highest sum element.

## Second star

Similar to the first star, instead it's necessary to retrieve all totals and sort them to get three best ones. I guess an alternative is looping and comparing the three top ones, but this way allows for flexibility (what if now they want n highest)
