## First star

This challenge is about traversing a string with a certain window and making sure all the characters in that window are different. How to do that in JS? `new Set()` will remove repeated items in an entry, so it's easy to detect repeated values.

## Second star

As I was getting the substring with a `slice` and a constant for the window size, all I had to do was changing the window size constant to get this solution. This year I am getting a lot of these almost trivial solutions, is it just me?
